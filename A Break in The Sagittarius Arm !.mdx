 ## A Break in The Sagittarius Arm!


# Highlights:
> Break is due to higher angle of Star Formation (SF) region than previously predicted.
Found by mapping the radial velocities of stars in the region.
The SF region is 44 deg higher than previously predicted giving rise to notion of break in the continuous arm.

Measuring the shape, size, and number of spiral arms is a challenge because Earth is locate inside the galaxy. Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech.*</center> 

Living inside the Milky-way Galaxy it is very difficult to observe our own Galaxy. So, most of our understanding about our Galaxy’s structure comes from observation of other Spiral Galaxies. Spiral arms determine how the Star Forming (SF) regions would be. All’ s good here as generally in Spiral Galaxies, SF regions trace the spiral pattern of their respective arms.


# What changed suddenly?
While studying the Sagittarius arm of our galaxy(Sun is in the Orion arm), scientists found an unusual break, meaning, they found SF regions at an higher angle than what was previously thought.(Refer Fig below)

This meant that, in the Sagittarius arm, SF regions didn’t trace the general spiral pattern as was previously thought. This was unremarkable for the general model of the Spiral Galaxies.

# How did Scientists find out the break?

For this they traced groups of Young Stellar objects (YSO), which are a link between stellar content and the spiral arms. Mapping the radial velocities of stars in the YSO’s they found out a pattern which was never observed before.

> Measuring their radial velocities and plotting it against Galactic longitude, they found the unusual break in the arm.

For this they used data from Spitzer/IARC telescopes and the data from Gaia telescope was used for measuring distances. One Reason for using YSO groups was that the parallaxes are more easily determined for a group of objects. To be sure and to eliminate any unwanted errors, they used 8 groups of YSO. Thus, such discoveries are beacons that a lot more is unknown about our own Galaxy, let alone other nearby Galaxies or the Observable Universe.
